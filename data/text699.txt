Welcome to ChicagoNow. Meet
            our bloggers,
            post comments, or
            pitch your blog idea. Fresh Beer Events, occasional bacon, but always spam free, opt out any time. Writer, trivia maven, fan of many things. I thought to learn all there is to know about beer as a way to stay interested in learning. It is my pleasure to bring Chicago's craft beer scene to you.
