In Apocalypse Then, we revisit movies that depict the onset of nuclear war and the immediate aftermath of annihilation. You know—for fun.   Last January, when Creed director Ryan Coogler joined up with Marvel to direct Black Panther, it seemed unlikely that he’d have room in his schedule to make the inevitable Creed sequel. Now, /Film is reporting that Sylvester Stallone—who played supporting character Rocky Balboa in the first movie—has been tapped to… Advertisement  Frequent documentary subject Ai Weiwei stepped behind the camera to make his own docu-essay Human Flow, spending years traveling the world to find images that illustrate our seemingly never-ending refugee crisis, which has lately become a political wedge issue in some countries—including the United States. As someone… Harvey Weinstein jokes weren’t the only thing cut out of last week’s episode of Saturday Night Live; we also lost a new Kyle Mooney/Beck Bennett/Gal Gadot rap parody to the vagaries of time and dress rehearsal whims. But Saturday night’s loss is Tuesday morning’s gain, since NBC released the video for public… Who remembers the 2009 horror movie Orphan? Spoiler alert: The evil little girl in it turns out to be a 33-year old woman with a condition that stunts her physical growth, thus allowing her to pose as someone much younger than she actually is. After watching Bella Hadid on Complex’s Sneaker Shopping, one might assume… For the iZombie uninitiated, Rose McIver plays Liv, a zombie coroner who eats the brains of the bodies that come through her morgue to satiate her appetite for human flesh. In doing so, she’s able to (temporarily) absorb their character traits and memories. The show’s mythos raises a lot of questions, the least… Just a few days out from the release of Masseduction, her fifth album under the moniker  St. Vincent, Annie Clark has released a third single from the record, “Pills.” Combining the electronic thump of St. Vincent’s last single, “Los Ageless,” with Clark’s electrifying guitar work and poignant, pleading vocals, the… In a story that’s becoming increasingly familiar but no less sickening, another woman has come forward to accuse ousted Weinstein Co. head Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment. According to Variety, actress and screenwriter Louisette Geiss states that Weinstein tried to force her to watch him masturbate while she was… Yesterday, we reported that The Wrap founder Sharon Waxman had accused The New York Times of backing down from a story she had written in 2004 that would have exposed Weinstein’s alleged history of sexual abuse because of “intense pressure” from high-profile figures in the movie industry—specifically actors Matt Damon… Five years ago, Vertigo dethroned longtime champion Citizen Kane in the once-per-decade Sight And Sound poll, becoming film critics’ consensus choice for the greatest movie ever made. Survey those same critics about the single greatest scene in cinema history, however, and a different Hitchcock movie would almost… Humble’s newest bundle is filled with RPGs that will give you hours upon hours of enjoyment. Each price tier is highlighted by a Borderlands game, but several lesser-known titles are included as well. Anyone familiar with the work of Quentin Tarantino knows the firebrand aesthete can’t tell one story without referencing at least a few dozen others. As such, his films are kibble for ravenous film buffs, who love drawing lines between Tarantino’s visual and linguistic motifs and those of his forebears. While… Riverdale is a unique show. It balances the weird, quirky humor of its source material with the dark, teen soap opera tropes The CW is know for, and the series’ popularity can be attributed to this balancing act. Riverdale fans are likely to accost the show’s stars, like KJ Apa and Cole Sprouse (Archie and Jughead,… Debuting last week on Netflix after its world premiere at Fantastic Fest, the Stephen King adaptation Gerald’s Game is a dream come true for its director, Hush and Ouija: Origin Of Evil’s Mike Flanagan. Flanagan first read King’s novel when he was 19 and has been attempting to get the film made ever since, a feat that… Before the New York Times story on the decades of sexual assault allegations against him came out (not to mention the more recent and more horrifying New Yorker piece), Harvey Weinstein was a major donor to the campaigns for several Democrat politicians. A few of them—including Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren—have … Advertisement  Last year, Amazon announced the development of a TV version of the award-winning horror podcast Lore; the  series premieres Friday, October 13 on Prime Video. In the video above, Lore creator Aaron Mahnke discusses  reengineering the podcast for television. The allegations against ousted movie mogul Harvey Weinstein continue to build—following a damning exposé published by The New York Times on his alleged history of sexual misconduct, three women, including writer/director/actress Asia Argento, have come forward with sexual assault allegations in a New Yorker piece by… We’ve seen USB battery packs that can jump start a car, and we’ve seen USB battery packs that can charge new MacBooks and Nintendo Switches, but this is the first we’ve found that can do both. A decade ago today, Radiohead released its shatteringly good seventh album, In Rainbows. At the time, much attention was paid to the then-revolutionary “pay what you want” scheme, but over time the record developed a reputation as containing some of the band’s wiliest compositions and brightest production. It’s a… Even though the episode’s title doesn’t end up being the central storyline (or even the B-plot, for that matter), the Meryl Streep costume party is, without a doubt, the best part of “Jeremy & Anna’s Meryl Streep Costume Party.” Matching each character to whichever Meryl Streep character they best embody (or think… It’s hard to escape the influence of Bonnie Tyler’s 1983 melancholic power ballad “Total Eclipse Of The Heart.” Even before the recent surge in popularity, its impact was hard to deny. The song (and its video) has been covered and  parodied by dozens of artists, with even Warby Parker getting in on the action.
